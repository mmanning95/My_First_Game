# Roguelike Game (Learning Project)

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a **roguelike game** that I am building as part of my learning process. The game is being developed following the **Roguelike Tutorial** (found [here](https://www.roguetutorials.com/)), which serves as a foundation to learn key programming concepts such as game loops, input handling, and procedural content generation.

The project is intended as a **learning experience**, and I plan to expand it with additional features and mechanics as I progress beyond the tutorial.

## Learning Goals

- **Understand game development principles**: The project is primarily aimed at helping me understand the fundamental principles of roguelike games, including **procedural generation**, **turn-based combat**, and **dungeon exploration**.
- **Familiarity with Python and libraries**: This project utilizes **Python** and **libtcod** to create the game's visuals and mechanics.
- **Building a project structure**: Working on this project has helped me improve my skills in organizing and structuring code in larger projects.

## Current Features

As of now, the game includes some of the basic mechanics defined in the tutorial:

- **Player movement**: The player can move through a grid-based map using keyboard inputs.

## Future Features

Once I complete the tutorial, I plan to add the following features:

- **Inventory system**: Allowing the player to pick up, use, and manage items.
- **Expanded combat**: Adding more complex combat mechanics, such as different enemy types and attack strategies.
- **Enhanced graphics**: Improving the game's visuals with more detailed graphics and animations.
- **Sound and music**: Integrating audio to enhance the game experience.
- **Save/load system**: Allowing the player to save and load their progress in the game.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/roguelike-game.git
cd roguelike-game
